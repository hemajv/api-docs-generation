# Generating API docs using Generative AI methods

The objective of this project is to conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) exploring the feasibility of utilizing generative AI (GenAI) for writing API documentation. The primary focus involves taking the codebase for the Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS) project and generating API documentation from it using generative AI. This documentation will then be compared against manually written human documentation to evaluate its overall quality.
